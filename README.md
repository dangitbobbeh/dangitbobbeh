## Background

📚 MBA from Baruch College | BA in Politics from Oberlin College

I've worn a lot of hats—software engineer, real estate investor, entrepreneur. Currently running a luxury watch business that I started in 2023, which is why I keep building tools to automate the tedious parts.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not programming, you might find me:
- 🎸 Listening to shoegaze
- 🃏 Playing Magic: The Gathering
- 🧠 Reading about animal intelligence or the neurobiology of laughter
- 🧀 Going down rabbit holes about the history of dairy
