# Hi, I'm David 👋

Software engineer with a background in full-stack development, commercial real estate, and entrepreneurship. I build tools that solve real business problems. Usually ones I've encountered firsthand.

## What I'm Working On

**[Watch Inventory](https://github.com/dangitbobbeh/watch-inventory)** — Full-stack inventory management for luxury watch dealers. Features AI-powered CSV import that automatically maps any spreadsheet format, profit analytics, and multi-tenant auth. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and Claude API.

**CrowdMeter** — iOS app for performers to measure audience response in real-time. Exploring the intersection of performance and data.

**MusicMatch** — iOS app for users to connect to others listening to the same music in the same vicinity. Building social connections beyond the screen.

## Past Work

## Background

MBA from Baruch College | BA in Politics from Oberlin College

I've worn a lot of hats—software engineer, real estate investor, entrepreneur. Currently running a luxury watch business that I started in 2023, which is why I keep building tools to automate the tedious parts.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not programming, you might find me:
- Listening to shoegaze
- Playing Magic: The Gathering
- Reading about animal intelligence or the neurobiology of laughter
- Going down rabbit holes about the history of religion
